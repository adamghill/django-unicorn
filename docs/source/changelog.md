# Changelog

## 0.62.0

- Security fix: for CVE-2025-24370 for a class pollution vulnerability (reported by [superboy-zjc](https://github.com/superboy-zjc)).

**Breaking changes**

- Remove support for Python 3.8 and 3.9 because Django 5.0 has dropped support.

## 0.61.0

- Add [`template_html`](views.md#template_html) to specify inline template HTML on the component.
- Add `resolved` method which only fires once even when there are multiple actions, e.g. during a debounce.

## 0.60.0

- Silence warnings about multiple root elements for direct views.
- Handle `force_render` in nested children for direct views [#663](https://github.com/adamghill/django-unicorn/pull/663).
- Handle error when manually refreshing direct views.
- Handle component field type annotations for `dataclasses` and `Pydantic` `BaseModel` [#649](https://github.com/adamghill/django-unicorn/pull/649) by [siliconcow](https://github.com/siliconcow).
- Update `startunicorn` command to prevent spamming users and handle folder creation for nested components [#642](https://github.com/adamghill/django-unicorn/pull/642) by [felipmartins](https://github.com/felipmartins).

**Breaking changes**

- Unparseable `kwarg` argument passed into a component will be considered `None` instead of being converted to a string.

```html
<!-- If `abcde` is not a variable in the template context, it will get set to `name` as `None` whereas before it would get set as 'abcde' -->
{% unicorn 'hello' name=abcde %}
```

## 0.59.0

- Update logic to find components [#655](https://github.com/adamghill/django-unicorn/pull/655) by [jacksund](https://github.com/jacksund).
- Add fallback location to look for components.

## 0.58.1

- Try to prevent type hints from crashing components. [#639](https://github.com/adamghill/django-unicorn/issues/639)

## 0.58.0

This release could not have been made possible without the generous support of https://github.com/winrid and https://github.com/om-proptech. Thank you for sponsoring me and believing in `django-unicorn`! It also includes critical improvements to nested components from https://github.com/imankulov.

- Handle a list of `ValidationError` or just a string instead of requiring a the `dict` version.
- Better support for type annotations for component fields.
- Improved nested component support by [imankulov](https://github.com/imankulov).
- Add [`force_render`](views.md#force_render) and [`$parent`](actions.md#parent).

**Breaking changes**

Child components will not *by default* render the parent component anymore. If this is required for your child component, specify `self.parent.force_render = True` in any action that requires the parent to re-render. This change will reduce network bandwidth and isolates the amount of re-rendering required for nested components.

## 0.57.1

- Add support for using both Alpine.js and `Unicorn` together in a component ([#597](https://github.com/adamghill/django-unicorn/pull/597) by [imankulov](https://github.com/imankulov)).
- Do not send a 304 if the child has a parent ([#595](https://github.com/adamghill/django-unicorn/pull/595)).
- Prevent sending the child DOM if there is a parent to reduce network payload size.
- More verbose error message when a component can not be loaded ([#453](https://github.com/adamghill/django-unicorn/pull/453) by [nerdoc](https://github.com/nerdoc)).

## 0.55.0

- Support `List`/`list` type annotations for component actions and fields ([#582](https://github.com/adamghill/django-unicorn/pull/582)).
- Fix: calling a method in a parent will have the request available ([#583]https://github.com/adamghill/django-unicorn/pull/583).
