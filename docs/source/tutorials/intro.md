# Meal Plan Tutorial

```{note}
This tutorial is intended to familiarize you with some basic concepts around Django Unicorn. If you have little to no prior experience with Django or other web frameworks, this is a good place to start. However, having basic knowledge of Python and web development concepts will prove helpful.
```

The goal of this tutorial is to develop a Meal Plan application. With Django Unicorn, you will be able to create "Meals" and add them without refreshing the page. This will include basic form validation, as well as a way to clear your list automatically.

Let's dive in!
