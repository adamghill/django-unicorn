# Meal Plan Tutorial

```{note}
This tutorial is intended to familiarize you with some basic concepts around Django Unicorn. If you have little to no prior experience with Django or other web frameworks, this is a good place to start. However, having basic knowledge of Python and web development concepts will prove helpful.
```

The goal of this tutorial is to develop a Meal Plan application. With Django Unicorn, you will be able to create "Meals" and add them without refreshing the page. You will also be able to search dynamically for saved Meals.
