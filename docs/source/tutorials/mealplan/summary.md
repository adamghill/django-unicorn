# Summary

Congratulations!

By the end of this tutorial, not only were you able to build a small Django application, but you were also able to incorporate Django Unicorn to allow for some awesome, reactive, and dynamic data manipulation without the need to rely on any external frontend frameworks.

You learned how to create a component/template combo that allows for highly reactive functionality. You were able to change field values dynamically, as well as conduct database operations (creating a record or deleting records) with minimal setup. 

And there's much more to uncover with Django Unicorn. Take a look at the documentation to see what else you can discover!

You can see the [finished code for this tutorial](https://github.com/tataraba/django-unicorn-tutorial-app) on Github.
